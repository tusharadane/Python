    "\n",
    "Control structures in Python are constructs that determine the flow and execution of a Python program. They enable you to make decisions, repeat tasks, and handle exceptions based on various conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow control statements in Python are essential tools that help you manage how your program runs. They serve two primary purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional Statements: These are used to perform specific operations based on whether a condition is True or False. They allow your program to make decisions and execute different code paths accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looping Statements: These statements enable your program to perform certain operations repeatedly for a finite number of times or until a particular condition becomes False. They are used when you want to automate tasks that need to be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer Flow Statements: These statements control the flow of your program by transferring control from one part of the code to another. They include statements like break, continue, and return, which help you manage the execution flow in more complex ways."
